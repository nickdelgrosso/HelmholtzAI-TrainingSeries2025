    "This notebook is meant to help you get ready for Monday's session.  On Monday, we'll be jumping into some of the aspects of `Git` and `GitHub` related to automated code quality checking and collaboration, both in toy examples and in real projects from your team:\n",

    "  - GitHub Pull Requests & Protected Branches to do Trunk-Based Development\n",
    "  - GitHub Remotes & Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions\n",
    "  - Commits with Git & using pre-commit to format and lint code with  nbqa and ruff \n",

    "The sections below have information on how to get a common computational environment set up for the session, and which commands and procedures would be helpful to be familiar with before coming to the session, to get the most out the unit.  The commands below are terminal commands--if you are familiar with how to do the same tasks using the `VSCode` graphical interface, that is also totally fine for our purposes."
