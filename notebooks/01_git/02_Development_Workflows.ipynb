Different workflows have emerged to address different team sizes, release schedules, and collaboration patterns. This notebook introduces four popular Git workflows and helps you understand when each might be appropriate for your projects.\n",

    "## Practical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Starting Points\n",
    "\n",
    "Most teams benefit from starting simple:\n",
    "1. **Start with GitHub Flow** - It's easy to learn and teaches good habits\n",
    "2. **Add complexity only when needed** - If you need scheduled releases, consider Microsoft Flow\n",
    "3. **Move toward Trunk-Based** as your CI/CD matures\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hybrid Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Many teams adapt these workflows to their needs:\n",
    "- GitHub Flow + release branches for hotfixes\n",
    "- Trunk-Based Development with very short feature branches for code review\n",
    "- Microsoft Flow with more frequent releases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Success Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of workflow chosen:\n",
    "- **Clear team agreement** on the process\n",
    "- **Automated testing** to catch issues early\n",
    "- **Code review** practices (usually via Pull Requests)\n",
    "- **Documentation** of your team's specific workflow\n",
    "- **Regular retrospectives** to improve the process\n",
