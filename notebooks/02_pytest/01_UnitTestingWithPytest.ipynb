    "\n",
    "Anything that your code can do, you can check.  If you find yourself manually checking for something, putting that check in an automated test helps you continue doing it as you develop your project further, automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "[`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) contains a test runner that looks for automated tests; one way it finds them is by looking for function names that start with the word `test_`, in file names that start with the word `test_`.  It runs each function it finds, and marks down whether running it:\n",
    "  - **Passed**: The function ran with no errors\n",

    "### Why Write Automated Tests?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While software developers often discuss automated testing in terms of quality control for gaining others' trust in our code in large projects, in practice, automated testing tools are used for a wide variety of development tasks that help speed up the development process.  Here are just a few examples, to show how pervasive automated testing is:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Checklist Automation**: Do you find yourself rerunning your code a lot to confirm that it still works?  This can slow down our workflow and hurt our creative flow, if it takes too long.  For each check you need to do, just write an automated test and free up our brain space!\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Colleague Onboarding**: Is everything ready for your colleagues to make contribution to your code?  If they can run some automated tests, then you can be confident that things are installed and ready on their machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Troubleshooting Time Reduction**: Each time you run your code, does it take you a few minutes to work out  where the problem is?  Unit tests turn those minutes into seconds, making it easier to quickly pin down why our code isn't working. \n",
    " \n",
    "  1. **Design Tools for Tricky Algorithms**: Do you feel like a  particular function feels more like a brain teaser than usual?  Write a few tests as you work on it, to free up some brain space that's focused on checking the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Code Structuring Guidance**: Wondering if your code is still modular?  Writing tests is a great software architecture check--unit-testable code is modular code!\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **UX Guidance**: Wondering if your functions are intuitive to use for others? A great check is to write unit tests, and see if the test code is complicated.  Simple tests mean intuitive interfaces!\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Getting Started Help**: Not even sure how to get started with a project, or what you really should do?  Write a test on a program you would *like* to write!  The test will fail, of course (because the code isn't written yet), but you'll then have a clear idea of what needs done, and in what order.\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Bug Fixing**: A user is reporting a bug in your code?  Write an automated test to recreate the bug, so that the test fails when the bug is present.  Then, fix the code!  \n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Code Review Simplification**: Want to speed up code review when accepting contributions?  Require tests on new code! If you're happy with the tests, and they pass, then the code is likely already good to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Mentoring Aid**: Have a junior who wants to contribute, but isn't sure how?  Sit together with them and write some tests that they should get to pass.  That way they have feedback on their progress to their goal, and you get code that works!\n",

    "| **Integration Test** | Check that a function, method, or class calls other functions or methods the way you expected. | Check: Calling `predict()` calls the OpenAI API with certain parameters. |\n",
    "| **System Test** | Check that the whole project works on a high level.  | Check: when I run my pipeline on my data, I get the figures I want. |\n",
    "| **Smoke Test** | Checks that nothing is crashing. | Check: When I run my script, it doesn't error out. |\n",
    "| **Behavior Test** | Checks that the program works along the user's expectations | Check: when I press the `fit` button, I see a model fit on-screen. |\n",
