    Test-Driven Development is a software development approach where you write tests *before* writing the implementation code. The cycle follows three steps:

    1. **Red**: Write a failing test for the next small piece of functionality
    2. **Green**: Write just enough code to make the test pass
    3. **Refactor**: Clean up the code while keeping tests passing

    This practice helps ensure your code is testable, encourages simple designs, and provides immediate feedback on correctness.
