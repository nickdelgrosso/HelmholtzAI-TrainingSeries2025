This hast the only purpose that, when the script is executed the way you just did, the function `main()` is called. Our aim is to patch this `main()` function to fully simulate this experiment so that it never executes any PsychoPy code and so that we can run it without having to manually press any buttons."

    "To start, create a script called `run_simulated.py` in the same folder as `experiment.py` and import the the `main` function from `experiment`. Now we can call this function using a context manager that patches a certain part of the module, for example:\n",
