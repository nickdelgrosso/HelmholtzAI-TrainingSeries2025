### What is Automated Testing?

Anything that your code can do, you can check.  If you find yourself manually checking for something, putting that check in an automated test helps you continue doing it as you develop your project further, automatically.


## Workshop Agenda

This round, we'll familiarize ourselves with the `pytest` Python package and the process of writing unit tests.  

**Important**: Complete the notebook `01_UnitTestingWithPytest.ipynb` before the start of the workshop.  That way, we'll have a lively conversation from the beginning and can jump straight into the group activities, which will help us understand testing more deeply and practice applying it to our work.
