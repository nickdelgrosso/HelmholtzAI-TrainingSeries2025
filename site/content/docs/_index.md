# Welcome!

This training program is designed especially for **early-career professionals**, such as the **Helmholtz AI consultants**, who bring strong domain expertise to short-term (3–12 month) consulting projects in machine learning applications. Many of you are working in **bioinformatics, neuroscience, and related domains**, but the skills taught here are broadly relevant across data-intensive research.

The focus of this series is not just on *coding*, but on learning the **software development practices** that make research projects easier to **collaborate on, maintain, and scale**. These practices are critical for professionals like you, who must quickly build reliable solutions in fast-moving projects, while working with diverse collaborators.

## Schedule

The series runs across 8 sessions. Each session includes a mixture of **concepts, hands-on practice, and applied discussion**. Details are still being finalized, but here is the overall plan:

|  | Session | Date | Description |
|------|---------|------|-------------|
|  | Session 1 | October 6th, 2025 | Introduction, Tools and workflows for effective coding in teams using Git and GitHub |
|  | Session 2 | TBD |  |
|  | Session 3 | TBD |  |
|  | Session 4 | TBD |  |
|  | Session 5 | TBD |  |
|  | Session 6 | TBD |  |
|  | Session 7 | TBD |  |
|  | Session 8 | TBD |  |

## Structure of Each Session

Each workshop is carefully structured to maximize both learning and application:

1. **Pre-workshop materials**
   - Participants receive short readings, tutorials, or coding exercises to **onboard** and **review fundamentals**.
   - A dedicated **GitHub Discussions forum** provides space for questions and answers before the live session.

2. **Workshop session**
   - Live, interactive session focused on **group problem solving**.
   - Includes both **toy examples** (to learn concepts in a safe sandbox) and **applied breakouts** using real projects contributed by participants.

3. **Follow-up and consulting**
   - After each session, I am available for **one-on-one or small group consulting**, helping participants apply the practices to their **own consulting projects**.

4. **Team reflection and planning**
   - The Helmholtz AI consulting team meets to **reflect** on the past session, and to discuss how to **steer the direction** of the training series for upcoming sessions.

## Why This Matters

Building scientific machine learning applications is not only about models and data. For consultants working on short-term projects, **the way you build your code matters as much as what it does**. By strengthening your skills in collaborative development, testing, reproducibility, and project design, you will:

- Deliver **higher quality solutions** to collaborators.
- Make your work easier to **hand over and sustain** after the consulting period ends.
- Build skills that will continue to pay off throughout your career, regardless of domain.

This series is about **raising the baseline of scientific software development** — so that every project you work on is not just effective in the short term, but also **maintainable, scalable, and reproducible** in the long run.
