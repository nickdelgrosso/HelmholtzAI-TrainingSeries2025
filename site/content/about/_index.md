This training series is a collaboration between **Nicholas Del Grosso** and the **Piraud Group at Helmholtz AI**. This is the second project we've worked on together, building on our shared commitment to advancing software development practices in scientific computing.

The training series runs **monthly**, with sessions conducted both **online** and **in-person** at the Helmholtz AI offices. This hybrid format allows for flexible participation while maintaining opportunities for hands-on collaboration and direct interaction.
